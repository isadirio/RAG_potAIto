            "- 2 tablespoons of olive oil\n",
            "- 1 tablespoon of finely ground espresso or instant coffee\n",
            "- 1 teaspoon of paprika\n",
            "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
            "- Fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)\n",

            "5. Roast the potatoes in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside, while tender on the inside. Make sure to stir them once or twice during cooking for even browning.\n",
            "6. Once done, remove the roasted potatoes from the oven and let them cool slightly. Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.\n",
